### Software Used
- AWS CLI
- AWS SAM CLI
- AWS Tools
  - CloudFormation
    We use CloudFormation to model and set up our AWS resources using yaml templates that describes all the
    AWS resources we want, and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources.
    We are also using AWS SAM to build our Serverless Application Model that automatically handles the code
    upload for us (in addition to auto resoucre allocation).
  - IAM
    IAM is a core part of our stack, we use IAM to set permissions for each roles and create developer accounts for
    accessing resources, and also API keys for CLI applications we use (eg. aws-cli, sam-cli).
    IAM rules are also defined in our CloudFormation templates to enable access rights from lambda functions to
    DynamoDB and API Gateway.
    S3 bucket policy and CloudFront permissions are also set by our CloudFormation templates.
  - Lambda
    We use Lambda, in conjunction with API Gateway, to manage the websocket conenctions (conenct, broadcast,
    disconnect), and interacts with DynamoDB for persistent data storage (connected users, update history, borad
    info, etc.) and dynamically query for the data we need. All requests sent from users will be forwarded to and
    handled by one of the three lambda functions we have.
    This resouce is managed by AWS Serverless Stack.
  - WebSocket API (API Gateway)
    API Gateway WebSocket APIs are bidirectional. A client can send messages to a service, and services can
    independently send messages to clients. This bidirectional behavior enables richer client/service interactions
    because services can push data to clients without requiring clients to make an explicit request.
    We use WebSocket API to handled the websocket connections from users, and data will be forwarded to
    responding Lambda functions.
  - DynamoDB
    DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that supports tables of virtually any size with horizontal
    scaling. DynamoDB scales to more than 10 trillion requests per day and with tables that have more than ten
    million read and write requests per second and petabytes of data storage.
    DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is an in-memory cache that delivers fast read performance for your tables at scale
    by enabling you to use a fully managed in-memory cache.
    We use DynamoDB to store all history update information, pixel colors and connection IDs.
  - CloudWatch
    Amazon CloudWatch collects and visualizes real-time logs, metrics, and event data in automated dashboards to
    streamline your infrastructure and application maintenance.
    All our function outputs and logs will be stored in CloudWatch and can be retrived at anytime.
  - S3
    We use Amazon S3 for two main purposes:
    1. Storing the static front-end website and serve as origin for Amazon CloudFront.
    2. Holding tamplate files and source codes for serverless function, which will be used in CloudFormation and
    SAM Deploy.
  - CloudFront
    We use Amazon CloudFront to securely deliver the front-end website with low latency and high transfer speeds.
    CloufFront will use the S3 bucket as origin to distribute resources acros its infurstructure.
### Spam Protection
This is achieved at server side as each connection will have a rate limit (1 update per 5 minutes) when sending
drawing information. The frontend javascript will prevent users from sending more than 1 draw requests in 5
minutes. This also prevents bots from spamming requests to occupy our bandwidth.
Even if the user modifies our client, the lambda will not accept new update requests sent by users during their
Even if the user modifies our client, the lambda will not accept new update requests sent by users during their
cool down time and it will not be broadcasted other users, and the user who requested the update will be
notified through websocket with the wait time.
### Broadcast Updates
This is handled using AWS Lambda in part with API Gateway to broadcast the information to all clients still
connected.
When our lambda received a legitamate draw update, it will scan the dynamodb table, where we maintain to
keep track of all active clients, to find all currently connected clients and broadcast the update.
An entry will be inserted to the connections table when a new connection opens. If we find a stale connection or
a connection closes, the table of connections will be updated to reflect the change. This table is useful for our
serverless design because we can keep track of the current connections.
### Scalability
Since our application is cloud-native (all achieved using AWS lambda and API Gateway), the scalability aspect of
out service is completely handled by AWS.
Our applications shines in the aspect of scalability as it can ultilize AWS's global infrastructure and its potential
to dynamically scale up or down our services. Our system's performance will stay the same no matter how
many users or concurrent requests we have as reponse time won't slow down as our database grows thanks to
highly scalable Websocket API and DynamoDB's single-digit millisecond performance, nearly unlimited
throughput and storage, built-in memory cache (DAX), and automatic multi-Region replication, as well as
lambda function's automatic scaling, multi-AZ and load balancing.
- Vertical
We can simply increase the memory limit of our function as a cloud formation setting when deploying the stack,
and AWS will also allocates CPU power proportional to the amount of memory provisioned (up to 10 GB of
memory and 6 vCPU cores).
The same thing goes to our dynamoDB and the front-end static site.
DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that supports tables of virtually any size with horizontal
scaling. DynamoDB scales to more than 10 trillion requests per day and with tables that have more than ten
million read and write requests per second and petabytes of data storage.
Amazon S3 was designed from the ground up to handle traffic for any internet application. It can be
dynamically scaled according to demand and will be billed on a pay-per-use model.
- Horizontal
As traffic increases, Lambda increases the number of concurrent executions of our functions. When a function
is first invoked, the Lambda service creates an instance of the function and runs the handler method to process
the event. After completion, the function remains available for a period of time to process subsequent events. If
other events arrive while the function is busy, Lambda creates more instances of the function to handle these
requests concurrently.
For an initial burst of traffic, the cumulative concurrency in a Region can reach between 500 and 3000 instances
per minute, depending upon the Region. After this initial burst, functions can scale by an additional 500
instances per minute.
Current soft limit: 1000 concurrent executions (set by AWS, can increase upon request).
The same thing goes to our dynamoDB and the front-end static site.
DynamoDB instantly accommodates the workloads as they ramp up or down to any previously reached traffic
level. If a workloadâ€™s traffic level hits a new peak, DynamoDB adapts rapidly to accommodate the workload.
Our Amazon S3 bucket is already been served from multiple AZ, and can be configured to use Amazon S3
Replication which enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets (that can be
in other region).
### Availability
AWS Lambda runs our function in multiple Availability Zones to ensure that it is available to process events in
case of a service interruption in a single zone.
Our front-end website also run on AWS infurstructre (S3 and CloudFront). Our S3 bucket objects (source codes)
are automatically stored across multiple devices spanning a minimum of three Availability Zones, each
separated by miles across an AWS Region. S3 Standard storage class is designed for 99.99% availability.
We also use CloudFront to accelerate the requests from users.
In addition to the support of AWS global infrastructure, Amazon CloudFront offers an origin failover feature to
help support our data resiliency needs. CloudFront is a global service that delivers contents through a
worldwide network of data centers called edge locations or points of presence (POPs). If contents are not already
cached in an edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin (S3 in this case) for the definitive version of
the content.
### Security
Our application is cloud-native, and all resources are accessed through AWS SDK with proper roles/permisions
set (no VPC/subnet/EC2 involved). Our database is only accessible from our developer accounts and Lambda
functions. The permission are precisely set as each Lambda function will only have access to the table they
need (not the entire db). We only have a websocket (which is handled by API Gateway) exposed to the public,
and invalid requests will be rejected either by API Gateway or our Lambda functions.
Our S3 buckets are also set to be only accessible by the cloudfront user using IAM role.
Our S3 buckets are also set to be only accessible by the cloudfront user using IAM role.
Since we have no VPC nor subnets, we do not need to worry about the inbound rule, and the same also applys
to outbound rules.
### Design Decisions
We designed our application to be cloud-native to take full advantage of AWS's insfurstrcutes. All codes are
deployed serverless-ly to reduce the hassle of scaling and mataining the servers and databases.
Our approach also reduce the cost of running the application. All AWS services we used can be set to use payper-use billing model, which means our system won't cost much and takes less resources (if not none for most
cases) if the userbase is small, and can also automatically scale up without any intervention while requests start
to grow.
To achieve serverless, we have chosen to use Lambda+API Gateway to handle websockets and S3+CloudFront
to handle static contents.
We chose to use DynamoDB for its fast response time, and it's also secure because IAM access is required to
interact with DB; the permission can be set on a per-table basis. It is also easy to access DB given the Amazon
SDK is powerful and easy to use.
We choose to use DynamoDB because it is build with DAX in-memory cache that delivers fast read performance
our tables at scale by enabling us to use a fully managed in-memory cache. This also means that we do not
need to use a Redis cluster for data caching.
### Weakness and Strength
- Weakness
Unencrypted websocket messages
Our system uses plain text websocket to communicate between servers to clients, which can be subject to
MITM attacks.
To midigate this, we can improve by using end-to-end encryption when sending messages using
websocket.
Lack of user identification
Our system is subject to DoS attacks as we do not have a user system reddit has. We are currently using
connection IDs to identify each unique user and that's not a reliable indicator when handling spam
messages.
- Strength
Low latency & Low reponse time
High Scalability & Availability (Performance at any scale)
Highly secure, only necessary resource exposed
